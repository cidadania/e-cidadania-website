        <h2>Mailing lists</h2>
        <p>e-cidadania mailing lists are places where people openly discuss about the platform or gives
         help to users who need it. There are some generic lists where the official language is english,
         in which people discuss about e-cidadania development and gives help to other users, but there
         are also mailing lists in your language. If you already searched and didn't find it, it can be
         that there are a very small user base in your language and because of that the mailing list
         wasn't created.</p>

        <h2>iRC</h2>
        <p>IRC channels are always a good option to ask questions. Currently we have three channels
         on the <a href="http://freenode.org">Freenode</a> network.

        <p>One last detail, we have to introduce <strong>Botizen</strong>, our robotic citizen who is
         in charge of the e-cidadania related channels. You can play with him, but don't tease him or
         he will get angry! ;)</p>
