        <h2>Mailing lists</h2>
        <p>e-cidadania mailing lists are places where people openly discuss about the platform or gives
         help to users who need it. There are some generic lists where the official language is english,
         in which people discuss about e-cidadania development and gives help to other users, but there
         are also mailing lists in your language. If you already searched and didn't find it, it can be
         that there are a very small user base in your language and because of that the mailing list
         wasn't created.</p>
         <ul class="unstyled">
            <h4>English (official)</h4>
            <li>ecidadania-dev@freelists.org</li>
            <li>ecidadania-users@freelists.org</li>
            <h4>Spanish</h4>
            <li>ecidadania-es@freelists.org</li>
            <h4>Galician</h4>
            <li>ecidadania-gl@freelists.org</li>
         </ul>

        <h4>How do I join a mailing list?</h4>
        <p>To join a mailing list, you must send an empty email with the subject "subscribe" (without the quotes) to the same address as
        the mailing list but adding "-request" at the end of the name.</p>

        <p>For example, if you want to join the development mailing list
        you should send an email to: <strong>ecidadania-dev-request@freelists.org</strong>.</p>

        <p>After that, you should receive an email telling you that you're subscribed to the list. From that moment you'll start
         receiving mail of the mailing list. If you feel like sending an email to the list you just have to send it to the regular
         list address (in the example: ecidadania-dev@freelists.org)</p>

        <h2>iRC</h2>
        <p>IRC channels are always a good option to ask questions. Currently we have four channels

        <h4>Channel bot</h4>
        <p>One last detail, we have to introduce <strong>Botizen</strong>, our robotic citizen who is
         in charge of the e-cidadania related channels. You can play with him, but don't tease him or
         he will get angry! ;)</p>
