        <h3><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
        <p>These ideas are main tasks for the e-cidadania project. E-cidadania project is very young, it has only 1 year of development
        so it does not have an active community that supports it...yet. In this project the students will find a perfect test field for
        them, since they can contribute to the project without having any fear to be wrong, and also have the chance to participate in
        the early stage of a project.</p>        
        <h3><a name="guidelines">Guidelines</a></h3>
        <p>Being an accepted student for the e-cidadania project is not as competitive as in KDE, but don't relax, you will have to
        adapt participative methodologies to an online (and therefore more limited) platform. We have the challenge to create a very
        versatile platform, and that is not easy.</p>
        <p>There are some established guidelines when coding and documenting in e-cidadania. That rules are a must, you can see them in
        <a href="http://docs.ecidadania.org/en/latest/dev/styleguide.html">the project documentation</a></p>
        <p>If for some reason you can't contact your mentor within 48 hours, you can try to contact the backup administrator, Armando Broz.
        Don't expect technical feedback from him.</p>
        <h3><a name="guidelines">Desirable prerequisites</a></h3>
        <p>The prerequisites of the e-cidadania platform are mostly the same for every project, they just vary in tiny little specs. Take in
        mind that even if we say "prerequisites", they are not decisive for selecting students. Students with no experience are welcome too.</p>
        <p>The students are desirable to have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mid-level knowledge of the Python programming language</li>
            <li>Some knowledge of the Django framework, previous knowledge is OK but it won't be decisive.</li>
            <li>Good or very good knowledge of web technologies: CSS 2 and 3, HTML4, JavaScript, jQuery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We repeat that this requisites are not decisive, after all every student must learn before anything, so don't be afraid to apply,
        your mentor is there to teach you :)</p>
        
        <h3><a name="ideas">Ideas</a></h3>
        <div class="well">
            <h4>We actively encourage students to publish their own ideas. If you feel like this list of ideas is not for you, but have
             another great idea you think it will fit in e-cidadania, please make us know! Send an email to oscar.carballal@cidadania.coop
             with the idea template filled and we will publish it <strong>immediately</strong>.</h4><br />

            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li>Project name:</li>
                <li>Knowledge required:</li>

        <h3><a name="core">Core</a></h3>
        
            <h4><a name="project1">Project: Enhance security</a></h4>
            <p><strong>Knowledge required:</strong> Django</p>
            <p><strong>Mentor:</strong> Oscar Carballal</p>
            <p>The main goal is to strengthen the user permissions and access to the platform. The current security with files, spaces,
             and most of the user interactions are vaguely filtered and mostly with hardcoded instructions. The platform must use all
             the mechanisms available in the django framework to guarantee the roles and permissions effectiveness in the platform.</p>
             
            <h4><a name="project2">Project: Speed improvements</a></h4>
            <p><strong>Knowledge required:</strong> Django, Python</p>
            <p><strong>Mentor:</strong> Oscar Carballal</p>
            <p>One of the main problems of e-cidadania is its response to user petitions, they're quite slow. The main goal is to improve
            the platform response, specially in the first load or with high loads of concurrent users (>1000).</p>
            
            <h4><a name="project3">Project: Theming system</a></h4>
            <p><strong>Knowledge required:</strong> Django</p>
            <p><strong>Mentor:</strong> Oscar Carballal</p>
            <p>e-cidadania distributes the participative processes within "spaces" that are configurable by their respective administrators.
            One of the main goals is that this spaces can be customized as the administrator pleases, to follow up the style of the process. The
            administrator must be able to create his own templates and CSS stylesheets and upload them to the space so they can be used.</p>
            <p>The styling provided by the administrator will be applied only to the space where he uploaded the files. This project includes
            the creating of an extensive documentation on how to make your own templates for the spaces.</p>
            
            <h4><a name="project4">Project: Graphical status of the process</a></h4>
            <p><strong>Knowledge required:</strong> Django, jQuery</p>
            <p><strong>Mentor:</strong> Oscar Carballal</p>
            <p>It would be nice to have some kind of system that allows the user to know graphically where and when h is on the process. Since every
            process can have multiple concurrent debates, proposals, or voting, the user can get easily lost. Some kind of timeline, at git/mercurial/bazaar, etc.
            style would be great. Every debate, proposal, etc. would be a branch, and they would be interconnected (meaning the relations between them) and at
            any time the user can view where he is, just looking at the "you are here" spot.</p>
            
        <h3><a name="modules">Modules</a></h3>
        
            <h4><a name="project5">Project: Automated reports</a></h4>
            <p><strong>Knowledge required:</strong> Reporting tools, Django, Python</p>
            <p><strong>Mentor:</strong> Oscar Carballal</p>
            <p>The automated reports system is one of the key features of e-cidadania. This tool must generate a PDF output on the space
            archive when finishing a process or on demand if the administrator requires it. There must be a predefined data model that
            will be automatically used after the process is closed, but the administrator must be able to specify the information needed
            to generate the report.</p>
            
            <h4><a name="project6">Project: Voting module</a></h4>
            <p><strong>Knowledge required:</strong> Django</p>
            <p><strong>Mentor:</strong> Oscar Carballal</p>
            <p>The voting module is one of the most important parts of e-cidadania along with the debates module. A voting module will
            be created with the ability to gather the information on the process proposals and redistribute them along with other data
            so the people can vote. Only the people related to that process/space can vote, and only one vote can be emitted by person.
            The hardest part of developing this module is to ensure that the votes are real. Part of the project is also to develop a
            system that guarantees that the vote emitted is true, taking in mind all the possible ways of digital communication and also
            other ways like digital certificates.</p>
            
            <h4><a name="project7">Project: Enhance debates module</a></h4>
            <p><strong>Knowledge required:</strong> Django, AJAX, jQuery</p>
            <p><strong>Mentor:</strong> Oscar Carballal</p>
            <p>It would be great if debates system supported interaction between some other modules like the proposals module and
            allowed media content and comments in the notes system.</p>
            
            <h4><a name="project8">Project: Make debates usable on mobile devices</a></h4>
            <p><strong>Knowledge required:</strong> Responsive design, CSS, jQuery</p>
            <p><strong>Mentor:</strong> Oscar Carballal</p>
            <p>Actual debate modules design allows it to be used almost in every place, but not in the current smartphones, where the
            "drag&drop" feature is gesture based. The idea is to develop a responsive design that when detects a smartphone (or
            a potential one) changes the design of the debate system allowing a better interaction to the user from their smartphone.</p>
            
        <h3><a name="testing">Testing</a></h3>
        
            <h4><a name="project9">Project: Create unit tests</a></h4>
            <p><strong>Knowledge required:</strong> Django, unittest2</p>
            <p><strong>Mentor:</strong> Oscar Carballal</p>
            <p>e-cidadania lacks of any unit test. The objective would be to create a complete test suite for the basic modules,
            so that guarantees its stability. The test would be realized with the test framework provided by django, using python's
            unittest.</p>
